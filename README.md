# Income-Prediction


# Enhancing the Airbnb Performance through Price Prediction and Market Segmentation using Machine Learning

welfare and social inequality in society is still a problem. what causes the factors and solutions must be emerged.

## Objective

Look for the factors that most determine a person's salary
Variable analysis regarding the data

# HOW?
Data-Driven classification **income Prediction** by modelling machine learning



# Data Pre-Processing
## Missing Values
The missing values in the data need to be cleaned up so that machine learning modeling can be performed effectively later on. 

This is the step i did:
1. Dropping columns with too many null values.
2. Removing rows with null values for specific columns.
3. Deleting duplicate data.
4. Feature Engineering

# Exploratory Data Analysis
After that, simple data visualization and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) were conducted to gain insights from the data. 

# Machine Learning
Two types of machine learning were performed, namely Income Prediction (classification).
